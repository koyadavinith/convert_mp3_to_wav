To use this script, you'll need to have the pydub library installed. You can install it using pip:

``pip install pydub``

To run the script, save it as a Python file (e.g. convert_mp3_to_wav.py) and open a terminal or command prompt in the folder where the file is saved. Then run the following command:

``python convert_mp3_to_wav.py /path/to/mp3/folder /path/to/wav/folder
``

Replace `/path/to/mp3/folder` with the path to the folder containing the MP3 files you want to convert, and `/path/to/wav/folder` with the path to the folder where you want to save the WAV files. The script will convert all the MP3 files in the MP3 folder and save the resulting WAV files in the WAV folder.
